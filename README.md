# üì∞ Fake News Detection System

## üìå Project Overview

In today's digital age, the rapid dissemination of information has made it challenging to distinguish between genuine and fake news. This project aims to develop a **Fake News Detection System** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishhh25/Fake_News_Detection_System.git
   cd Fake_News_Detection_System
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

üìú Usage
Data Preprocessing and Model Training:

Open and run the fakenews_detection.ipynb notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.
Real-Time News Scraping:

Use the Scraper.py script to fetch and preprocess news articles for real-time analysis.
Model Inference:

Load the pre-trained models (model_BernoulliNB.pkl, model_GaussianNB.pkl, or model_RandomForestClassifier.pkl) to classify new news articles as real or fake.
üß† Machine Learning Models
The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective model for fake news detection:

Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Suitable for binary/boolean features.
Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes features follow a normal distribution.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
The pre-trained models are saved in the repository for immediate use.
